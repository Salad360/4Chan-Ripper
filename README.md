# 4Chan-Ripper
## A simple file scraping script for 4chan leveraging wget




This script uses standard wget commands to scrape files of a certain type, specified by the user, off of 4chan's CDN. Simply enter a thread URL, tell it which file extentions you want, optionally provide a path to save the files, and you're off the races!

Windows does not have wget natively, so you'll need the windows executable of wget for it to work.
